# property-management-prototype

Unfinished because my girlfriend at the time left the property management business. This is an example of a MVVM WPF client/server application which uses a database. Use the included PropMgmtDB.edmx.sql file to create the database skeleton, and the PropertyMgmtBase.sql file in the root directory to populate it with sample values.
